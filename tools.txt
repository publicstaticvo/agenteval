Outputs:
	str: A markdown string wtih the results.
242
Name: scitooleval/DetermineBonds
Description: The tool is used to determine the bond orders between atoms in a molecule based on their atomic coordinates. It assigns the connectivity information to the molecule by disregarding pre-existing bonds. This function is useful for inferring the chemical bonds in a molecule when the bond information is not already available or needs to be updated based on the 3D structure of the molecule.
Inputs: 
	smiles (str): A SMILES string. Input SMILES directly without any other characters.
Outputs:
	str: A markdown string wtih the results.
243
Name: scitooleval/IsSubstructof
Description: This tool is used to check if a molecule(target) is a substructure of another molecule(template). It returns true if the molecule is a substructure of the other molecule and false otherwise. The substructure search is performed by matching the SMARTS pattern of the query molecule to the target molecule.
Inputs: 
	target_template (str): Two SMILES strings separated by a '.'. The first SMILES string is the target molecule, and the second SMILES string is the template molecule.	                                Input SMILES directly without any other characters like CR(C)C(=O)O.CC(=O)O.
Outputs:
	str: A markdown string wtih the results, or an error message.
244
Name: scitooleval/GetTemplateMolecule
Description: This tool is used to get the template molecule from a TautomerQuery object.
